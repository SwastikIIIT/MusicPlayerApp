This is a music player app created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I have extensively used JavaScript to add various functionalities, such as skip previous, skip next, play/pause, loop, repeat, shuffle, and queue songs, by implementing the appropriate logic for each feature.

Additionally, I have used various events, such as loadmetadata, ended, click, load, and change, to make the app functional.
